    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project takes the data shown when viewing your profile on <a
            href="https://MyAnimeList.net/">MyAnimeList</a>, and parses it into a list of entries. The data is then used
        to create multiple different visualizations. It takes the form of a site that has you input a text file of an
        entire MyAnimeList profile page, found at &quot;myanimelist.net/animelist/&lt;username>&quot;</p>

    <h3 id="how-to-use">How to use</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of right now, the text parser is configured to only read
        properly when your anime list is set to a specific setting. To make it match, you need to match these settings
        exactly:<br><img src="images/readme/listcolumns.png" alt="List Settings"
            title="List Columns"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be found by navigating to
        your profile at &quot;myanimelist.net/profile/&lt;username>&quot;, then &quot;Profile Settings&quot; in the top
            right, then to the &quot;List&quot; tab and scroll down. Setting your manga list to the same settings and
            loading it will work, but probably has some small issues. Make sure to hit &quot;Submit&quot; at the top or
            bottom of the settings page before closing it.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, open your anime list by going to
            &quot;myanimelist.net/animelist/&lt;username>&quot;. Make sure to load the entire page by scrolling to the
                bottom, or holding the &quot;End&quot; key until everything is loaded (the page only loads 300 entries
                to start). Use Ctrl+A to select all text on the page, Ctrl+C or right-click -&gt; copy to copy all text
                to the clipboard, and then paste it all into a text file. You can input this file into the site by
                clickint &quot;Change File&quot; then &quot;Choose file&quot; then selecting your text file. Then press
                &quot;Continue&quot;. If any of the buttons don&#39;t appear, reloading will likely solve it. Any time
                you submit a new file, the site will try to compare the old data with the new data, and report any
                differences.</p>
    <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
    <p>Since the project is made for my own use primarily, several things are assumed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The &quot;On-Hold&quot; section of the list is used for plan-to-watch entries that don&#39;t currently have
            an english dub.</li>
        <li>The &quot;Dropped&quot; section is unused, but should at the very least display entries as red in the main
            list</li>
        <li>All completed entries are scored, and have a watch start and watch end date recorded, although not having
            any of those shouldn&#39;t cause any significant error</li>
        <li>All minute lengths of entries are calculated assuming that you watch in 2x speed</li>
        <li>Several entries are hard coded to be grouped together in the &quot;Groups&quot; section, but not having
            these entries won&#39;t cause any error</li>
    </ul>
